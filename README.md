# Try Out Development Containers: Data API builder & Azure SQL

[![Open in Remote - Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Remote%20-%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-dab)

A **development container** is a running [Docker](https://www.docker.com) container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

This is a sample project that lets you try out either option in a few easy steps. We have a variety of other [vscode-remote-try-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+vscode-remote-try-&type=Repositories) sample projects, too.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace or dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.


## Setting up the development container

### GitHub Codespaces

Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespaces:

1. Click the Code drop-down menu and select the **Codespaces** tab.
1. Click on **Create codespaces on main** at the bottom of the pane.

For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace).

### VS Code Dev Containers

If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-sqlserver) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Dev Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the ".NET Core" sample, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

### About this template

This template creates two containers, one for the Dev Container that includes .NET and Data API builder and one for Microsoft SQL Server. You will be connected to the Ubuntu, and from within that container the MS SQL container will be available on **`localhost`** port 1433. The Data API builder container also includes supporting scripts in the `.devcontainer/sql` folder used to configure the `Library` sample database.  

The SQL container is deployed from the latest developer edition of Microsoft SQL 2022. The database(s) are made available directly in the Codespace/VS Code through the MSSQL extension with a connection labeled "LocalDev".  The default `sa` user password is set to `P@ssw0rd!`. The default SQL port is mapped to port `1433` in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`.

Data API builder is a .NET Core application that provides a RESTful API for interacting with the SQL server.  

Data API builder automatically starts and connects to a database titled "Library", that includes sample data. In case stopped this Dev Container and you want to manually start Data API Builder you can use the following commands:

```bash
cd DAB-Config && dab start --config=dab.config.json
```

The `dab_http_request.sh` file includes multiple examples of how to use the Data API builder to interact with the SQL server.

#### Changing the sa password

To change the `sa` user password, change the value in `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` and `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

#### Database deployment

By default, a  demo database is created titled "Library".  To add additional database objects or data through T-SQL during Codespace configuration, edit the file `.devcontainer/sql/library.azure-sql.sql` or place additional `.sql` files in the `.devcontainer/mssql/` folder. *Large numbers of scripts may take a few minutes following container creation to complete, even when the SQL server is available the database(s) may not be available yet.*

Alternatively, .dacpac files placed in the `./bin/Debug` folder will be published as databases in the container during Codespace configuration. [SqlPackage](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/tools/sqlpackage) is used to deploy a database schema from a data-tier application file (dacpac), allowing you to bring your application's database structures into the dev container easily. *The publish process may take a few minutes following container creation to complete, even when the server is available the database(s) may not be available yet.*

### Adding another service

You can add other services to your `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` file [as described in Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#service-configuration-reference). However, if you want anything running in this service to be available in the container on localhost, or want to forward the service locally, be sure to add this line to the service config:

```yaml
# Runs the service on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
network_mode: service:db
```

### Using the forwardPorts property

By default, web frameworks and tools often only listen to localhost inside the container. As a result, we recommend using the `forwardPorts` property to make these ports available locally.

```json
"forwardPorts": [9000]
```

The `ports` property in `docker-compose.yml` [publishes](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/#published-ports) rather than forwards the port. This will not work in a cloud environment like Codespaces and applications need to listen to `*` or `0.0.0.0` for the application to be accessible externally. Fortunately the `forwardPorts` property does not have this limitation.
